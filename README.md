**CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY USING EFFICIENTNET METHOD**

**Introduction**

Diabetic retinopathy, referred to as diabetic eye disease, is a health condition where the retina suffers damage as a result of diabetes mellitus. This condition is a primary cause of blindness, affecting a significant portion of individuals who have had diabetes for over two decades. Often, diabetic retinopathy manifests without early indicators. Retinal (fundus) photography, accompanied by manual analysis, is commonly utilized as a screening method for diabetic retinopathy, offering performance levels that may surpass those of in-person dilated eye examinations.

Automated systems for assessing the severity of diabetic retinopathy have proven invaluable in speeding detection and treatment. One of them is using deep learning to classify images. In this project, the efficientnet method is used using data from Kaggle.
